///
/// Because buffers are passed by ownership to the runtime, Rust's slice API

/// API: [`slice()`]. The method takes ownership of the buffer and returns a
/// `Slice<Self>` type that tracks the requested offset.

/// # Implementation notes
///
/// Buffers passed to `io-uring` operations must reference a stable memory
/// region. While the runtime holds ownership to a buffer, the pointer returned
/// by `stable_ptr` must remain valid even if the `IoBuf` value is moved.

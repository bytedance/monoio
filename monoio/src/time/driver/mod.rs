/// Time implementation that drives [`Sleep`][sleep], [`Interval`][interval],
/// and [`Timeout`][timeout].
///
/// A `Driver` instance tracks the state necessary for managing time and
/// notifying the [`Sleep`][sleep] instances once their deadlines are reached.
///
/// It is expected that a single instance manages many individual
/// [`Sleep`][sleep] instances. The `Driver` implementation is thread-safe and,
/// as such, is able to handle callers from across threads.
///
/// After creating the `Driver` instance, the caller must repeatedly call `park`
/// or `park_timeout`. The time driver will perform no work unless `park` or
/// `park_timeout` is called repeatedly.
///
/// The driver has a resolution of one millisecond. Any unit of time that falls
/// between milliseconds are rounded up to the next millisecond.
///
/// When an instance is dropped, any outstanding [`Sleep`][sleep] instance that
/// has not elapsed will be notified with an error. At this point, calling
/// `poll` on the [`Sleep`][sleep] instance will result in panic.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// The time driver is based on the [paper by Varghese and Lauck][paper].
///
/// A hashed timing wheel is a vector of slots, where each slot handles a time
/// slice. As time progresses, the timer walks over the slot for the current
/// instant, and processes each entry for that slot. When the timer reaches the
/// end of the wheel, it starts again at the beginning.
///
/// The implementation maintains six wheels arranged in a set of levels. As the
/// levels go up, the slots of the associated wheel represent larger intervals
/// of time. At each level, the wheel has 64 slots. Each slot covers a range of
/// time equal to the wheel at the lower level. At level zero, each slot
/// represents one millisecond of time.
///
/// The wheels are:
///
/// * Level 0: 64 x 1 millisecond slots.
/// * Level 1: 64 x 64 millisecond slots.
/// * Level 2: 64 x ~4 second slots.
/// * Level 3: 64 x ~4 minute slots.
/// * Level 4: 64 x ~4 hour slots.
/// * Level 5: 64 x ~12 day slots.
///
/// When the timer processes entries at level zero, it will notify all the
/// `Sleep` instances as their deadlines have been reached. For all higher
/// levels, all entries will be redistributed across the wheel at the next level
/// down. Eventually, as time progresses, entries with [`Sleep`][sleep]
/// instances will either be canceled (dropped) or their associated entries will
/// reach level zero and be notified.

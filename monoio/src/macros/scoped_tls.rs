//! Scoped thread-local storage
//!
//! This module provides the ability to generate *scoped* thread-local
//! variables. In this sense, scoped indicates that thread local storage
//! actually stores a reference to a value, and this reference is only placed
//! in storage for a scoped amount of time.
//!
//! There are no restrictions on what types can be placed into a scoped
//! variable, but all scoped variables are initialized to the equivalent of
//! null. Scoped thread local storage is useful when a value is present for a known
//! period of time and it is not required to relinquish ownership of the
//! contents.

//! Monoio is a pure io_uring based rust runtime. Part of the design is borrowed
//! from tokio and tokio-uring. However, unlike tokio-uring which use uring over
//! epoll, monoio is not based on another runtime, which makes it more efficient.
//! Also, monoio is designed as thread-per-core model. Users don't need to worry
//! about Send and Sync of tasks and can use thread local storage.
//! For example, if user wants to do collect and submit tasks, he can use thread
//! local storage to avoid synchronization structures like Mutex; also, the
//! submit task will always be executed on the same thread.

/// The `AsyncReadRent` trait defines asynchronous reading operations for objects that
/// implement it.

/// It provides a way to read bytes from a source into a buffer asynchronously,
/// which could be a file, socket, or any other byte-oriented stream.

/// Types that implement this trait are expected to manage asynchronous read operations,
/// allowing them to interact with other asynchronous tasks without blocking the executor.

    /// non-zero `n` means the buffer `buf` has been filled with `n` bytes of data from this source.
    /// If `n` is `0`, it can indicate one of two possibilities:
    ///
    /// 1. The reader has likely reached the end of the file and may not produce more bytes, though
    ///    it is not certain that no more bytes will ever be produced.
    /// 2. The provided buffer was 0 bytes in length.

    /// The second half of the tuple that is returned is an

    /// It is not enforced that a stream implementation yields the declared
    /// number of elements. A buggy stream may yield less than the lower bound
    /// or more than the upper bound of elements.

    /// `size_hint()` is primarily intended to be used for optimizations such as
    /// reserving space for the elements of the stream, but must not be
    /// trusted to e.g., omit bounds checks in unsafe code. An incorrect
    /// implementation of `size_hint()` should not lead to memory safety
    /// violations.
    ///
    /// That said, the implementation should provide a correct estimation,
    /// because otherwise it would be a violation of the trait's protocol.

/// A reference to an open file on the filesystem.
///
/// An instance of a `File` can be read and/or written depending on what options
/// it was opened with. The `File` type provides **positional** read and write
/// operations. The file does not maintain an internal cursor. The caller is
/// required to specify an offset when issuing an operation.
///
/// While files are automatically closed when they go out of scope, the
/// operation happens asynchronously in the background. It is recommended to
/// call the `close()` function in order to guarantee that the file successfully
/// closed before exiting the scope. Closing a file does not guarantee writes
/// have persisted to disk. Use [`sync_all`] to ensure all writes have reached
/// the filesystem.
///
/// [`sync_all`]: File::sync_all

/// Creates a new file and write data to it:

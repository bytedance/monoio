# Platform Support

Linux and macOS are currently supported. On the Linux platform, we can use io_uring or epoll as the IO driver; on the macOS platform, we will use kqueue as the IO driver.

How to use Legacy driver can refer to [here](/docs/en/use-legacy-driver.md).

## Future Plans
ðŸš§Experimental windows support is on the way.

If you want to develop on Windows and deploy on Linux, then you can try wsl.

# Platform Support

Linux and macOS are currently supported. On the Linux platform, we can use io_uring or epoll as the IO driver; on the macOS platform, we will use kqueue as the IO driver.

The use of the Legacy driver is explained on [this page](/docs/en/use-legacy-driver.md).

## Future Plans
🚧Experimental windows support is on the way.

If you want to develop on Windows and deploy on Linux, then you can try wsl.
